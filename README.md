temporary way to share code I will find a way to commit push into the whole app to make it easier for everyone
also if you do decide to app these files to the app make sure they are in the right roots (folders) 

api_service.dart - path: /Virtual-Pet-App/pages/api_service.dart
server.js - path: /Virtual-Pet-App/my-backend/server.js #you need to make a new folder "my-backend" and the server.js file in it

login_page.dart - just update the code

IMPORTANT - you need to install node.js and npm to run the backend server, and the server has to be running if you want to test
the app API calls
